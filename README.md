# Seed Envelope Template Generator

Generates custom seed envelope templates for Cricut or xTool vinyl cutters. Creates both cut lines (for the blade) and score lines (for the scoring head) in a single SVG file.

## Features

- **4 Predefined Seed Envelope Sizes**: #3, #4.5, #5, and #6 envelopes optimized for seed storage
- **Dual-Tool Support**: Cut lines for blade tool, score lines for scoring head
- **xTool M1 Ultra Optimized**: Vector-based paths for efficient processing
- **Clean UI**: Two-column layout with size selection and live preview
- **Download Options**: SVG and PDF export

## Changelog - Latest Session

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Fixed fold line issues**: Resolved diagonal line problems in SVG output
- **Vector-based paths**: Converted from individual line elements to single vector paths
- **Dual-tool optimization**: Separate cut lines (solid) and score lines (dashed) for xTool M1 Ultra
- **Proper path closure**: Eliminated unwanted diagonal lines with correct SVG path syntax

### üå± Seed Envelope Focus
- **Updated to seed storage sizes**: Replaced generic envelope sizes with seed-specific dimensions
- **4 optimized sizes**: #3 (2¬Ω" √ó 4¬º"), #4.5 (3" √ó 4‚Öû"), #5 (2‚Öû" √ó 5¬º"), #6 (3‚Öú" √ó 6")
- **Seed storage research**: Based on common seed packet envelope standards

### üé® UI/UX Improvements
- **Two-column layout**: 1/3 left column for size selection, 2/3 right column for preview
- **Streamlined interface**: Removed custom dimension inputs, focused on predefined sizes
- **Download buttons**: Positioned in lower right corner of preview area
- **Removed clutter**: Eliminated preview headers and legends for cleaner design

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Error handling**: Added comprehensive validation to prevent NaN errors
- **Separate functions**: Modular code with dedicated functions for cut lines and score lines
- **Flap design**: Rectangular flaps with top flap (full depth) and side/bottom flaps (half depth)
- **Proper layering**: Cut lines behind score lines for correct visual hierarchy

### üìê Template Structure
- **Cut lines**: Solid black perimeter with rectangular flaps of varying depths
- **Score lines**: Dashed black rectangle around envelope body for folding
- **Flap configuration**: Top flap (full depth), side/bottom flaps (half depth)
- **Clean geometry**: No diagonal lines or path closure issues
